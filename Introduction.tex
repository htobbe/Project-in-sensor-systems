As a part of the Master program in Electronic systems and Instrumentation, the first semester of the 2$^{nd}$ are divided into two projects. The first project is about sensors and the next is about electronic systems. These two projects is ideally used as preliminary project for the main project in the Masters degree. The main goal for this project is to prepare for an eventual project where vision technologies are being used. To do this, an earlier lab task about a drain tank controlling is converted from pressure based system to a vision based system. This camera supplies the system with a feedback signal to a PID controller.
