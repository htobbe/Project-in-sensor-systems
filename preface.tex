\section*{Preface}

The objective for this project is to build a camera based system for measuring the liquid level in a transparent drain tank, then use the data from the camera to create a feedback for a level control system. This project can further be divided into the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop a software for detecting and calculating the liquid level in a cylindrical, transparent tank using a RGB camera.
    \item Assemble/prepare a drain tank system ready to measure liquid level.
    \item Write LabView code for Vision Acquisition.
    \item Write PID controller algorithm using LabView to control the pump in the drain tank.
    \item Testing and modulate controller parameters with Ziegler-Nichols tuning method and Integral-Time-Absolute-Error \textbf{(ITAE)} criteria.
    
\end{itemize}
